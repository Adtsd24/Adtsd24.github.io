  <body>
    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p> This is some text. </p>
    This is some more text, just like that.
    <b> This is bold text. </b>
    <i> And this is italic (cursive) text. </i>
    <bi> And this should be bold italic, right? Well no, it isnt. This isnt a correct tag in HTML. Lets try another way now: </bi>
    <p> <b> <i> Maybe this is bold italic? Welp, it sure is! </i> </b> </p>
  </body>
